## What is SeC?

**SeC (Segment Concept)** is a breakthrough in video object segmentation that shifts from simple feature matching to **high-level conceptual understanding**. Unlike SAM 2.1 which relies primarily on visual similarity, SeC uses a **Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)** to understand *what* an object is conceptually, enabling robust tracking through:

- **Semantic Understanding**: Recognizes objects by concept, not just appearance
- **Scene Complexity Adaptation**: Automatically balances semantic reasoning vs feature matching
- **Superior Robustness**: Handles occlusions, appearance changes, and complex scenes better than SAM 2.1
- **SOTA Performance**: +11.8 points over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS benchmark

### How SeC Works

1. **Visual Grounding**: You provide initial prompts (points/bbox/mask) on one frame
2. **Concept Extraction**: SeC's LVLM analyzes the object to build a semantic understanding
3. **Smart Tracking**: Dynamically uses both semantic reasoning and visual features
4. **Keyframe Bank**: Maintains diverse views of the object for robust concept understanding

The result? SeC tracks objects more reliably through challenging scenarios like rapid appearance changes, occlusions, and complex multi-object scenes.

- The node automatically falls back to standard attention if Flash Attention is unavailable

## GPU VRAM Recommendations

Based on a highly optimized automatic VRAM offloading mechanism, any GPU with more than 3 GB of VRAM can smoothly run SeC-4B video segmentation.  

## Nodes Reference

### 1. SeC Model Loader
Load and configure the SeC model for inference. Automatically detects available models in `ComfyUI/models/sams/`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **model_file** | CHOICE | First available | Select which model to load:<br>• FP32 (Full Precision - ~14.5GB)<br>• FP16 (Half Precision - 7.35GB)<br>• BF16 (Brain Float - ~7GB)<br>• FP8 (8-bit Float - 3.97GB)<br>• SeC-4B (Sharded/Original - ~14GB)<br>**Note:** Each model uses its native precision automatically |
| **device** | CHOICE | `auto` | Device selection (dynamically detects available GPUs):<br>• `auto`: `cuda:0` if available, else CPU (recommended)<br>• `cpu`: Force CPU (automatically converts to float32)<br>• `cuda:0`, `cuda:1`, etc.: Specific GPU |
| *use_flash_attn* | BOOLEAN | True | Enable Flash Attention 2 for faster inference.<br>**Note:** Automatically disabled for FP32/FP8 precision (requires FP16/BF16) |
| *enable_cpu_offload* | BOOLEAN | True | Enables CPU offloading (block swapping) to save VRAM |
| *vram_limit* | INT | 0 | VRAM usage limit in GB (0 = Auto) This is a reference value, not an absolute value! |
| *allow_mask_overlap* | BOOLEAN | True | Allow objects to overlap (disable for strict separation) |

**Outputs:** `model`

**Notes:**

- **Model Selection**: Dynamically shows available models in `ComfyUI/models/sams/` directory
  - Download at least one model format (see Model Download section above)
  - Models are loaded in their **native precision** (FP8 stays FP8, no upconversion!)
  - This preserves all memory benefits of smaller model formats
- **Config files**: Bundled in this repo - no separate download needed for single-file models
- **CPU mode**: Automatically converts model to float32 precision (CPU limitation). CPU inference is significantly slower than GPU (~10-20x).
- **Flash Attention**: Automatically disabled for FP32 and FP8 models (requires FP16/BF16). Standard attention will be used instead.

---

### 2. SeC Video Segmentation
Segment and track objects across video frames.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **model** | MODEL | - | SeC model from loader |
| **frames** | IMAGE | - | Video frames as IMAGE batch |
| *positive_points* | STRING | "" | JSON: `'[{"x": 100, "y": 200}]'` |
| *negative_points* | STRING | "" | JSON: `'[{"x": 50, "y": 50}]'` |
| *bbox* | STRING | "" | Bounding box: `"x1,y1,x2,y2"` |
| *input_mask* | MASK | - | Binary mask input |
| *tracking_direction* | CHOICE | `forward` | forward / backward / bidirectional |
| *annotation_frame_idx* | INT | 0 | Frame where prompt is applied |
| *object_id* | INT | 1 | Unique ID for multi-object tracking |
| *max_frames_to_track* | INT | -1 | Max frames (-1 = all) |
| *mllm_memory_size* | INT | 12 | Number of keyframes for semantic understanding (affects compute on scene changes, not VRAM). Original paper used 7. |
| *offload_video_to_cpu* | BOOLEAN | False | Offload video frames to CPU (saves significant GPU memory, ~3% slower) |
| *auto_unload_model* | BOOLEAN | True | Unload the model from VRAM and RAM after segmentation. Set false if doing multiple segmentations in succession. |

**Outputs:** `masks` (MASK), `object_ids` (INT)

**Important Notes:**

- Provide at least one visual prompt (points, bbox, or mask)
- **Output always matches input frame count**: If you input 100 frames, you get 100 masks
- Frames before/after the tracked range will have empty (blank) masks
  - Example: 100 frames, annotation_frame_idx=50, direction=forward → frames 0-49 are blank, 50-99 are tracked
  - Example: 100 frames, annotation_frame_idx=50, direction=backward → frames 0-50 are tracked, 51-99 are blank
  - Example: 100 frames, annotation_frame_idx=50, direction=bidirectional → all frames 0-99 are tracked

**Input Combination Behavior:**

You can combine different input types for powerful segmentation control:

| Input Combination | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Points only** | Standard point-based segmentation |
| **Bbox only** | Segment the most prominent object within bounding box |
| **Mask only** | Track the masked region |
| **Bbox + Points** | **Two-stage refinement**: Bbox establishes initial region, then points refine the segmentation within that region |
| **Mask + Positive points** | Only positive points **inside the mask** are used to refine which part of the masked region to segment |
| **Mask + Negative points** | All negative points are used to exclude regions from the mask |
| **Mask + Positive + Negative** | Positive points inside mask refine the region, negative points exclude areas |

**Example Use Cases:**

- **Bbox + point refinement**: Draw bbox around a person, add point on their shirt to segment just the shirt instead of the whole person
- **Rough mask + precise points**: Draw a rough mask around a person, then add positive points on their face to focus the segmentation
- **Mask + negative exclusions**: Mask an object, add negative points on unwanted parts (e.g., exclude a hand from a person mask)
- **Point filtering**: Positive points outside the mask boundary are automatically ignored, preventing accidental selections

**⚠ Important Note on Negative Points with Masks:**

- Negative points work best when placed **inside or near** the masked region
- Negative points far outside the mask (>50 pixels away) may cause unexpected results or empty segmentation
- You'll receive a warning in the console if negative points are too far from the mask

### 3. Coordinate Plotter
Visualize coordinate points on images for debugging.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **coordinates** | STRING | `'[{"x": 100, "y": 100}]'` | JSON coordinates to plot |
| *image* | IMAGE | - | Optional image (overrides width/height) |
| *point_shape* | CHOICE | `circle` | circle / square / triangle |
| *point_size* | INT | 10 | Point size in pixels (1-100) |
| *point_color* | STRING | `#00FF00` | Hex `#FF0000` or RGB `255,0,0` |
| *width* | INT | 512 | Canvas width if no image |
| *height* | INT | 512 | Canvas height if no image |

**Outputs:** `image` (IMAGE)


## Tracking Directions

| Direction | Best For | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **forward** | Standard videos, object appears at start | Frame N → end |
| **backward** | Object appears later, reverse analysis | Frame N → start |
| **bidirectional** | Object clearest in middle, complex scenes | Frame N → both directions |


### Understanding mllm_memory_size

The `mllm_memory_size` parameter controls how many historical keyframes SeC's Large Vision-Language Model uses for semantic understanding:

- **What it does**: Stores frame references (first frame + last N-1 frames) for the LVLM to analyze when scene changes occur
- **VRAM impact**: None - testing shows values 3-20 use similar VRAM (~11-13GB for typical videos)
- **Compute impact**: Higher values mean more frames processed through the vision encoder on scene changes
- **Quality trade-off**: More keyframes = better object concept understanding in complex scenes, but diminishing returns after ~10-12 frames
- **Original research**: SeC paper used 7 and achieved SOTA performance (+11.8 over SAM 2.1), emphasizing "quality over quantity" of keyframes

**Recommended Values:**

- **Default (12)**: Balanced approach - higher than paper's 7 for extra context, but not excessive
- **Low (5-7)**: Faster inference on simple videos, matches original research setup
- **High (15-20)**: Maximum semantic context for very complex videos (no VRAM penalty)

**Why doesn't it affect VRAM?** The parameter stores lightweight frame indices and mask arrays, not full frame tensors. When scene changes occur, frames are loaded from disk on-demand for LVLM processing. The underlying SAM2 architecture supports up to 22 frames.

**Dataset**: The original work includes the [SeCVOS Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS) dataset.

## Known Limitations

**Mask-Only Inputs**: Using only a mask or bounding box may result in less stable tracking. This is due to how the underlying SAM2 and MLLM components process mask and bbox inputs. For best results, combine masks/bboxes with coordinate points for more precise control.

## Troubleshooting


**CUDA out of memory**:

- Enabling `enable_cpu_offload` to save VRAM, use it with `vram_limit` to further reduce VRAM usage.
- Enable `offload_video_to_cpu` (saves 2-3GB VRAM, only ~3% slower)
- Also ensure you are using the fp8 variant for maximum VRAM saving
- Process fewer frames at once (split video into smaller batches)
- See GPU VRAM recommendations above for your hardware tier

**Slow inference**:

- Enable `use_flash_attn` in model loader (requires Flash Attention 2)
- Disable `offload_video_to_cpu` if you have sufficient VRAM
